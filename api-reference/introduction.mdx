  for information on how to interact with our endpoints.

## Welcome

Our API is a set of endpoints that can be used to automate common tasks
outside of the website.

The endpoints can be used to generate AI dorks, bulk Google dork search,
language translations, and single query dorks. Our API can be easily integrated into various tools and workflows.

Here's a brief description of each endpoint:

- Generate AI dorks: Use this endpoint to generate AI dorks based on a query.
- Bulk Google dork search: Use this endpoint to search Google for a list of
  queries based on a give file uploaded through our website.
- Language translations: Use this endpoint to translate your dorks from one language
  to another.
- Single query dorks: Use this endpoint to generate a single query dork based
  on a query.
