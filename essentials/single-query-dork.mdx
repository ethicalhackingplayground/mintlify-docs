This page is for learning how to run a single Google dork query. If you are new to Google dorks, you can learn more about them on our [Introduction to Google Dorks](https://docs.dorki.io/google-dorks) page.

1. Navigate to the Dashboard

  src="/images/single-query/dashboard.png"
  alt="Hero Light"
/>
<img
  className="hidden dark:block"
  src="/images/single-query/dashboard.png"
  alt="Hero Dark"
/>

2. Type in a Google dork or Generate some from our AI dorks page (explained later), then click Run Dork.

<img
  className="hidden dark:block"
  src="/images/single-query/query.png"
  alt="Hero Dark"
/>

3. Wait, until the search completes for the results to be displayed, the first search is always the slowest because the results need to be cached in memory.
